It is possible to solve Laplace equation in 
ParFlow by noticing that it is a particular
case from the Richards equation. 

The scripts:

test_brick_2d.tcl and test_brick_2d_with_p4est.tcl

Set up the parameters that need to be passed to
the Parflow's Richards solver to perform the above
task. With these two scripts, we try to compute p
such that 

		\Delta p = 0,

in two dimensions based on the solution 
		
		p(x,y) = cos(x)cosh(y).

We compare the results obtained with the upstream
version of ParFlow and with the version that uses
p4est as a meshing back-end. Ideally the results
should be identicall. 

The scripts:

test_brick_3d_tcl and test_brick_3d_with_p4est.tcl

do the similar for the three dimensional form of (1)
based on the solution

		p(x,y,z,t) = xyzt + 1.

See the steps0_tests_{2,3}d.tcl for details in the mesh
configuration for each test.
