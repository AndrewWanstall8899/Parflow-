We are trying to generalize to  #Subgrids per procesor > 1. The
easiest case possible is running the code with only one processor
with two subgrids:

#  +-----+-----+
#  |     |     |
#  |     |     |
#  +-----+-----+
#
#  Nx = Ny = 12
#  PARFLOW + P4EST
#  P=2, Q=1     	Mx=6 My=12, --> 2 Trees and initial level 0

This configuration is prohibited in the stantard Parflow version and
we have forced the code to run under these conditions in the Parflow+p4est
implementation. As expected the code crashes in several places. So far
we have identified:

- Set up the send and recv processor arrays in the correspoding message envelops (communication.c)
- The vector and matrix  allocation (vector.c and matrix.c)
- The Non linear solver, in particular the grids needed for the multigrid V-cycle. (mg_semi.c)
