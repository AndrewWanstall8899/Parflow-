It is possible to solve Laplace equation in 
ParFlow by noticing that it is a particular
case from the Richards equation. 

The scripts:

test_brick_2d.tcl and test_brick_2d_with_p4est.tcl

Set up the parameters that need to be passed to
the Parflow's Richards solver to perform the above
task. With these two scripts, we try to compute p
such that 

		\Delta p = 0,

in two dimensions based on the solution 
		
		p(x,y) = cos(x)cosh(y).

We compare the results obtained with the upstream
version of ParFlow and with the version that uses
p4est as a meshing back-end. Ideally the results
should be identicall. 

We currently do not support the use of a preconditioner
in this step. Hence it has been deactivated in both
test_brick_2d.tcl and test_brick_2d_with_p4est.tcl 
to make the comparison meaningful.

See the steps0_tests.tcl for details in the mesh
configuration for each test.
