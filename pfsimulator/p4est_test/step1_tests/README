It is possible to solve Laplace equation in 
ParFlow by noticing that it is a particular
case from the Richards equation. 

The scripts:

test_brick_2d.tcl and test_brick_2d_with_p4est.tcl

Set up the parameters that need to be passed to
the Parflow's Richards solver to perform the above
task. With these two scripts, we try to compute p
such that 

		\Delta p = 0,

in two dimensions based on the solution 
		
		p(x,y) = cos(x)cosh(y).

We compare the results obtained with the upstream
version of ParFlow and with the version that uses
p4est as a meshing back-end. Ideally the results
should be identicall. 

The run_step1_tests_2d.sh
runs Parflow with the two data sets provided by
the scripts above with different processor/grid/
subgrid configurations and compares the l2 norm
of the error in both cases. To run it just tipe

	./run_step1_tests_2d.sh 

in the current directory.

Additionally there is a steps1_tests.tcl script
which also runs the same test cases, but takes
advantage of some internal Parflow functions and
compares directly the pressure output file of each
case. To run it just type

	tclsh step1_tests.tcl

in the current directory. 

In case that further comparison is desired. By
executing both of the previous scripts, silo
files of the pressure field are produced. These
can be open with visit for visualization. Once
open choose add->pseudocolor->Pressure and
then click on the Draw buttom.
