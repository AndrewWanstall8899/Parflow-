It is possible to solve Laplace equation in 
ParFlow by noticing that it is a particular
case from the Richards equation. 

The scripts:

test_brick_2d.tcl and test_brick_2d_with_p4est.tcl

Set up the parameters that need to be passed to
the Parflow's Richards solver to perform the above
task. With these two scripts, we try to compute p
such that 

		\Delta p = 0,                (1)

in two dimensions based on the solution 
		
		p(x,y) = cos(x)cosh(y).

We compare the results obtained with the upstream
version of ParFlow and with the version that uses
p4est as a meshing back-end. Ideally the results
should be identicall. 

The scripts:

test_brick_3d_tcl and test_brick_3d_with_p4est.tcl

do the similar for the three dimensional form of (1)
based on the solution

		p(x,y,z,t) = xyzt + 1.

We compare the results obtained with the upstream
version of ParFlow and with the version that uses
p4est as a meshing back-end. Ideally the results
should be identicall.

The steps1_tests_2d.tcl and steps1_tests_3d.tcl
scripts run test cases taking advantage of some internal
Parflow functions and comparing directly the pressure output
file of each case. To run it just type

	tclsh step1_tests_2d.tcl (resp. step1_tests_3d.tcl)

in the current directory. 

In case that further comparison is desired. By
executing both of the previous scripts, silo
files of the pressure field are produced. These
can be open with visit for visualization. Once
open choose add->pseudocolor->Pressure and
then click on the Draw buttom.
