This folder holds a complicated flowVR - parflow - workflow.
- run `./do.sh` to start it.
- now yo can e.g. try to connect with visit. Therefore navigate to File -> Open in visit and select the simulation from the ~/.visit/simulations directory


## for debugging:
- `./watch.sh` (will restart do.sh when parflow was rebuilt ;)
- `./visit_loader.py` (opens in visit. to reload after do.sh was restarted just type `reload()` in the ipython console!)
